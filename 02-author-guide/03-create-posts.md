#  Create Posts

By default, websites are structured hierarchically with folders and files. However, if you want to create a section for news or a simple blog, you can also sort pages inside a folder by date.

## Switch from Pages to Posts

To transform pages into posts or posts into pages, open a folder, click on the meta tab at the top of the page, and scroll down to the bottom. In the "Folder" section, you will find two options:

* Pages (sorted manually with drag & drop)
* Posts (sorted automatically by publish date for news or blogs)

When you switch to pages or posts and click on save, Typemill will automatically rewrite the files. If the folder is empty, nothing happens initially.

! **Note**
! 
! A folder with pages cannot be transformed into a folder with posts if the folder contains another sub-folder. It only works if the folder contains only pages.

## Add Posts

Posts are sorted by date in descending order, and they cannot be reordered manually using drag & drop. This is why posts are not listed in the interactive navigation. Instead, you will find a list of posts below the content area of the folder.

You can change the date manually in the meta tab of each page. If no manual date is set, Typemill uses the create date.
