# Revisions Plugin

With the revisions plugin you can track content changes and restore previous versions of your pages. The plugin is available with a BUSINESS license.

### Revisions

Once activated, a new "Revisions" tab will appear at the top of each page. Here, you can review all changes made to the content and easily restore previous versions with a click.

### Revision Settings

By default, the plugin creates a new revision under the following conditions:

- When a different user makes changes to the page.
- When the same user makes changes after 24 hours.
- When the page is published.

If the same user makes multiple changes within 24 hours, they are grouped into a single revision. You can adjust this time period (up to 120 hours) in the plugin settings to control the number of revisions created.

The system retains 10 revisions by default, automatically deleting older ones. You can customize the number of stored revisions in the plugin settings.

### Version Tracking

If you don’t need to track every change by a user, you can switch to "Versions" mode. In this mode, only published versions are saved as revisions. While you can still compare changes between versions, you won’t see which user made specific edits.

### Restoring Deleted Pages

By default, revisions are deleted when a page is removed. However, you can disable this behavior in the plugin settings to preserve revisions even after the page is deleted. If you later create a new page with the same URL, you’ll be able to view and restore the old revisions.
