You will find two sub-tabs:

* **Article:** In this tab, you can find the current article in Markdown and the prompt input below. 
* **Prompts:** In this tab, you can see the predefined prompts and store your own prompts.

## Article Tab

In the article tab, the content of the **current page** is loaded into a simple textarea field with pure Markdown syntax. The features are:

*  **Edit manually**: You can manually edit the content with pure Markdown syntax without any restrictions.
* **Prompt input**: Below the article, you can add a prompt in the prompt input field. Press the button or the return key to send the prompt.
* **Prompt selection**: Below the prompt input field, you have a list of predefined prompts. Click on a prompt to add it to the prompt input field. You can manage the predefined prompts in the prompt tab.
* **Versions**: Whenever you send a prompt, Typemill will create a new version of the article. Switch between versions with the paging below the article. 
* **Focus**: Mark a text and click the focus button if you want to edit or replace only a specific text in the article. You can also wrap text with the tags `` manually.
* **Store**: When you are ready with editing, you can store the article with the store button at the bottom of the article.

## Prompt Tab

Use the prompt tab to manage your own prompt collection. You'll also find predefined "system prompts" that are updated regularly. These cannot be edited, but you can activate or deactivate them. To customize a system prompt, copy its content and save it as your own.

### Features

- **Add a prompt**: Click `+add` (top left) to create your own prompt.
- **Edit/Delete**: You can modify or remove your own prompts at any time.
- **Filter**: Use the top-right filter to switch between system and personal prompts.

### Content

- **Title**: Appears below the prompt field in the article tab.
- **Content**: The actual prompt text.
- **Link** *(optional)*: Link to an article as a writing sample. You can instruct the AI to mimic its tone or structure.
- **Active Checkbox**: When checked, the prompt appears in the article tab for quick access.

## Exit

Please note that Typemill does NOT STORE any history of your edits. If you close Kixote without saving your changes, all edits will be lost, and Kixote will start fresh if you open it again. You can exit Kixote in two ways:

* Click the small close button at the top right side of Kixote.
* Click the exit button in the prompt input field.
