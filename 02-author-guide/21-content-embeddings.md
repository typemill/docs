## Plugin Shortcode

The plugin utilizes the shortcode feature. To integrate external content, click the shortcode button in the visual editor and select the "embed" shortcode. Then, copy and paste the URL of a video, map, or audio stream into the URL field.

## Privacy Feature

You can also activate and customize a privacy feature in the plugin settings. The privacy feature displays a box in the frontend with the title of the platform and a link to the platform's privacy policy. The embedded content is loaded when the user clicks the button. The user must agree to each platform individually. Once the user has agreed to a platform, media from that platform will always be loaded directly in the future.
