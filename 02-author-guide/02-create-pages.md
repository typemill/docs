#  Create Pages

A Typemill website is usually structured hierarchically with folders and files very similar to a file system on your computer. With the interactive navigation on the left side, you can easily create folders and files and reorder them with drag & drop.

If you want to create posts that are ordered by date instead of a manual hierarchical order, then read the next chapter, "Create Posts."

## The Interactive Navigation

The interactive navigation is located on the left side of the author interface. You can expand and collapse the whole navigation with the buttons at the top, or you can open and close folders individually with the arrow button on the right side of each folder.

To create a new page or folder, follow these steps:

1. Go to the navigation hierarchy where you want to create a new page or folder.
2. Enter a title in the input field. 
3. Click the document icon to create a page or the folder icon to create a folder.

After clicking the button, you will see the new item with a red line on the left, indicating that the page is not published yet. You can now move the navigation item with drag & drop, or you can click on the item to edit the content.

## Files or Folders

Files and folders are pretty much the same in Typemill, and both have content. The only difference is that folders can contain sub-content with files or folders. Folders are used to create a hierarchical content structure for your website, while files are the standard item for usual content without further hierarchies.

Do not worry too much about files and folders. You cannot transform a file into a folder later, but if you want to create sub-content in the future, you can always copy the content of a file to a new folder and then delete the file afterward.

## Change Slug and Navigation Title

If you want to change the title in the navigation or the slug (URL segment) of the page, then open the page and click the "meta" tab at the top. There you will find input fields for the slug and the navigation title. 

! **Hint**
! 
! If you change the slug of a page, then the page will reload with the new url. All other changes in the meta-tab that have not been stored yet will be lost.

## Delete a Page

If you want to delete a page, then open the page and click on the delete button at the sticky publish panel at the bottom of the page.

## Limitations

There are some limitations that you should know:

* The number of characters in a page name is currently limited to 100. However, you can change the navigation title in the meta tab without limitations. There are also some restrictions regarding the use of special characters. 
* You can move a folder within the same level, but you cannot move a folder inside another folder. If you move a folder to another folder, then all URLs of the folder and its files will change.
