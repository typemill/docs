# Plugin for Content Templates

The template plugin allows you to store custom templates or retrieve predefined ones from our template server. We currently provide templates from the Good Docs Project and for SOPs. A business license is required.

## Features

- Activate the plugin to see a "Templates" tab on each page.
- Save the current page as a template and build a collection of useful templates.
- Select from a growing template list fetched from our template server.

## Individual Template Collection

As a workaround without this plugin, you can also create your own templates in a separate content folder and copy and paste the content with the raw markdown editor each time. However, with the template plugin, you can do all this much more efficiently:

1. Create a new page and set up a general content structure.
2. Save it as a template.
3. Load and apply the template with just one click.

To update a template, you can store the current page with the optimized content as a new template and delete the old template.

## Combine with AI

Templates are very efficient for use as content templates for prompts with Kixote. Just create a new page, load a template, open Kixote, and start prompting.
