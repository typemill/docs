#  Publish Pages

Typemill provides flexible tools for editors to control the status of pages. Next to standard features like publish, depublish, and delete, authors can also modify published pages and discard changes. More features like hiding pages, restricting pages, and different kinds of references are possible in the meta tab.

## The Publish Panel

You can view and manage the status of the page in the sticky publish panel at the bottom. There, you can:

* **Publish** a page or publish modifications.
* **Discard** modifications and revert content to the published version.
* **Unpublish** a published page.
* **Delete** a page.

## Page Status

Depending on your actions in the publish panel, a page can have three different statuses, and the status of the page is indicated with colors in the publish panel and in the navigation. 

* **Unpublished (red)**: The page is not published and not visible in the frontend yet.
* **Published (green)**: The page is published and visible in the frontend.
* **Modified (orange)**: The page is published and has changes that have not been published yet.

This way, an author can always see the status of a page in the publish panel and the current state of the whole website in the navigation.

## Actions and Status

Here are some examples of how actions in the publish panel will change the status and the color: 

* **Save a draft**: The page is not published and not accessible in the frontend. The status color is red.
* **Publish a page**: The page is published and accessible in the frontend. The status color is green.
* **Unpublish a page**: The page is not accessible in the frontend and only accessible in the author interface. The status color is red again.
* **Delete a page**: The page is completely deleted in the frontend and in the author interface.
* **Save modifications**: The page is published and accessible in the frontend. The modified draft is only visible in the author interface. The status color is orange.
* **Discard modifications**: The modifications are deleted and the live version is restored in the author interface. The status color is green again.
* **Publish modifications**: The modifications are published to the live version. The status color is green again.
