#  Raw Markdown Editor

The Raw Markdown Editor in Typemill is designed for users who prefer to work directly with Markdown syntax. The code highlighting enhances readability and helps users easily identify syntax errors or formatting issues.

This editor allows for fine-tuned control over the content structure and formatting without the interference of a WYSIWYG interface. This is particularly useful for copying and pasting content or restructuring page content. You can also use advanced Markdown features like additional attributes for headlines, images, and more.

Some limitations of the editor include the lack of image or file upload capabilities. It is also harder to create complex Markdown elements like tables. In most cases, editors will switch between the Raw Markdown Editor and the Visual Markdown Editor depending on the editorial task.
