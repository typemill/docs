#  Editing Pages

Typemill is designed for content-focused websites. Editing pages feels much like writing documents. Two different Markdown editors, separate tabs for metadata, and a sticky publish panel at the bottom provide all the tools for intuitive and distraction-free content creation.

## The Markdown Editors

In the content section, you can choose between two Markdown editors:

* The [Visual Markdown Editor](/author-guide/visual-markdown-editor): A block-style editor with WYSIWYG mode. It provides immediate visual feedback for intuitive content creation.
* The [Raw Markdown Editor](/author-guide/raw-markdown-editor): A simple editor with syntax highlighting. This is useful for reordering content or copying and pasting large sections.

You can switch between editors using a button in the sticky publish bar. You can also set your default editor in the system settings.

## The Meta Tabs

At the top of the page, authors will find a tab for extensive metadata. Here, you can edit the slug, meta-title, meta-description, hero images, redirects, access control, and more. Plugins can add additional tabs for special data or features.

## the Publish Panel

The sticky publish panel at the bottom allows authors to save drafts, publish pages, discard changes, unpublish, or delete pages. Colors indicate the current status of the page. This status is also visible in the navigation on the left, providing a quick overview of the website's status.
