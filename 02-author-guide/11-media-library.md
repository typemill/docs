#   Media Library

UPDATE: Typemill provides a media library for managing images, video files, audio files, and various documents.

## Media Icons

The media components and library utilize four distinct icons to represent images, videos, audio, and files:

| Icon | Block Element | 
|:---|:---|
| ![Button Image](media/live/button-image.webp){.center loading="lazy" width="34" height="42"} | Show image files | 
| ![Button Video](media/live/button-video-file.webp){.center loading="lazy" width="34" height="42"} | Show video files | 
| ![Button Audio](media/live/button-audio-file.webp){.center loading="lazy" width="34" height="42"} | Show audio files | 
| ![Button File](media/live/button-file.webp){.center loading="lazy" width="34" height="42"} | Show other files | 
| ![Button Closed Eye](media/live/typemill-medialib-unused.webp){.center loading="lazy" width="32" height="32"} | Show unused media | 
| ![Button Upload](media/live/typemill-medialib-upload.webp){.center loading="lazy" width="32" height="32"} | Upload media |

## Open the Library

You can access the media library from any media component. Media components can be found within the visual editor, in the tabs, or within the configurations for systems, themes, and plugins. Each media component features a button labeled "Select from medialib." Depending on the component in use, the media library will display a list of images, videos, audio, or files.

You can also open the media library directly using a button located at the top right of each page. This is particularly useful for uploading new media to the library or adding media to the bottom of the page rather than a specific location.

## Search, Filter, and Upload

The media library offers a search function along with several filtering options for quickly locating media and files:

* **Search**: Use this feature to search for specific file names. It's important to name your files thoughtfully for easy retrieval. A helpful strategy is to use prefixes; for instance, all icons could be prefixed with "icon_." 
* **Filter**: The icons beneath the search bar allow you to filter media by images, audio, video, and files. 
* **Not in use**: The icon with the closed eye will check all content pages and metadata for references to files and images. It will show all media that have not been referenced anywhere. This can help you to clean up your media library. But be aware that Typemill does not check all data for references; for example, there might be other data from plugins or themes that use those files, so be careful before you delete any media.
* **Upload**: The button with the upload icon at the right enables you to add a single file. The system will automatically recognize the file type upon upload and activate the appropriate filter.
* **Pagination**: Below the filter section, pagination controls are available.

## Use Media

For each media item, you can choose from three options:

* **Use**: To incorporate a media file into the current image, video, audio, or file component, simply click on the preview.
* **Details**: To view information about the media file, click the info icon located at the bottom right.
* **Delete**: To remove a media file, click the trash icon at the bottom right.
