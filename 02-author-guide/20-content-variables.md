#  Variables and Snippets Plugin

The Variables and Snippets Plugin enables you to define reusable text variables and Markdown snippets in a central location. You can integrate them into your content using shortcodes. This plugin requires a BUSINESS license.

## Use Cases

This plugin is particularly beneficial for:

- **Manuals and Documentation**: Use variables for frequently changing details like names, prices, or product specifications.
- **Content Templates**: Create snippets for recurring sections, such as disclaimers, product descriptions, or contact information.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Centralize updates by editing a single variable or snippet, which then reflects across all pages.

## How It Works

Once activated, a new menu called "Variables" will appear in the Typemill system. Here, you can create, search, update, and delete all variables and snippets.

A **variable** is a key-value pair. For example, define a variable `price` with the value `$99.99`. Insert variables into content using shortcodes like `[:variable name="price" :]`.

A **snippet** is a larger block of reusable content written in Markdown. For example, create a snippet `contact-info` with your site's address and contact details. Insert snippets using shortcodes like `[:snippet name="contact-info" :]`.
