# Theme Developers

Typemill combines **Twig** templates with a collection of useful **theme variables** and **theme functions**. Most themes use the **Tachyons CSS** library by default, but you can also use **Tailwind CSS**, **Vue.js**, or any other stack you prefer.

!! Please use the new developer kit for theme development. It comes with a full Typemill installation and a **complete guide** that walks you through the new **Dev Theme**. You can download or clone it from [GitHub](https://github.com/typemill/dev).
