# Develop the Yaml File

Each layout needs a special configuration file. The configuration file is a simple yaml-file. It is similar to the yaml-definitions for themes and plugins. 

## Basic Information

The yaml-file starts with some basic information. The information will be displayed next to the preview image of the layout:

Name: Typemill

Sizes: A5 (148mm 210mm)

````

Nothing complicated here. Only the Name is mandatory. You can add as many information as you want, but keep in mind that it is displayed in the layout selection and too extensive information might destroy the layout.

## Define Everything with Forms

In the next section of the yaml-file you can define the forms that will appear in the settings-tab of the eBook. You can use all fields from the typemill [form-builder](/forms) there. The definitions start with the keyword `customforms`. Yes, you are right, this is flexible as hell, it means that you can define everything you need for you eBook-layout. Your eBook-cover has 3 images, 10 colors and 5 subtitles? No problem, just define it here!

These are the form-definitions for the eBook layout called "typemill":

All standardforms will be rendered automatically as soon as the user selects your layout.

You can add, delete or change forms like you want and create stunning ebooks with it. However, the input fields `originalimages` and `endnotes` are connected to backend functionalities. Don't change them, if you want to use these functionalities:

```
    fieldsetendnotes:
      type: fieldset
      legend: Endnotes
      fields:
        endnotes:
          type: checkbox
          checkboxlabel: Transform footnotes into endnotes
        endnotestitle:
          type: text
          label: Title for the endnotes page
    fieldsetimagequality:
      type: fieldset
      legend: Image Quality
      fields:
        originalimages:
          type: checkbox
          checkboxlabel: Use original images and do not resize them (use this for print only).
```

You can use the input of all forms in the twig template later.
