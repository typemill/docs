#   System Requirements

Typemill is a lightweight software with minimal requirements. All you need is:

* **PHP 8.1 - 8.3**
* **A web server** (Apache preferred; NGINX and IIS are also possible)
* **FTP** or another method to upload files to your server
* **No database** is required; Typemill stores everything in files.

Almost any hosting package provides a web server with PHP. If you've ever hosted web software like WordPress, you can run Typemill without any problems.

## Supported Browsers

Typemill supports the following browsers, in order of testing rigor:

* **Firefox** (heavily tested)
* **Chrome** (tested)
* **Edge** (basic tests)
* **Safari** (basic tests)
