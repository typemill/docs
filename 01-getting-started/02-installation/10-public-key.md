#  The Public Key

Typemill includes a file named `public_key.pem` in the settings folder. If this file is missing, an error notification will appear in the system settings. This file serves two main purposes:

* It authenticates API calls for version checks when accessing the system-, theme-, or plugin-area in the author interface.
* It validates your license data for any purchased plugins, themes, or services.

If you are not using licensed plugins, themes, or services and don't need version checks, you can disregard the error message, as there is currently no option to suppress it.
