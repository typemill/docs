# Make Variables Editable

In the final step, we want to make the variables for our CookieCconsent plugin editable, so that the user can choose his own colors, and add his own content in the TYPEMILL UI. In other words, we want to create a user interface. This might sound complicated. But it is totally easy. You don't have to write a single line of code; you just have to define the input fields in the configuration file of your plugin. So let'ss do this quickly.

## Define Input Fields in YAML

Let'ss remember that the YAML configuration file of a plugin can have up to three parts:

* The first part defines the basic properties of a plugin like the version, the name, or the author.
* The second part defines the default ``settings`` for the plugin.
* The last part defines the `forms` and `fields` for the user interface, so the user can edit the settings.

The field definitions always start with `forms` and `fields` in the YAML syntax:

````
forms:
  fields:
````

You can add as many fields as you need for your plugin. The rule is: The name of the field must be the name of your default setting. So if you have a default setting for "position" like this...

````
settings:
  ...
  ...
  position: 'bottom'
````

... then you define an input field with the same name like this:

````
forms:
  fields:
    position:
      ...
      ...
      ...
````

The field definition is pretty simple. If you know how to create fields in HTML, then you also know how to define them in YAML. 

Let's have a look at the `position` field. It is a select-box with four values. I am pretty sure that you already guessed how it is defined in YAML:

````
forms:
  fields:
    position:
      type: select
      label: Position of Cookie Banner
      options:
        bottom: Bottom
        top: Top
        bottom-left: Bottom left
        bottom-right: Bottom right  
````

It is basically the same as writing HTML. You simply add the type, the label, and the options.

## Fields in the User Interface

TYPEMILL will read all your field definitions, and automatically create a user input field in the TYPEMILL settings UI. TYPEMILL will also insert the default value into the field and, of course, store the user input in the settings. 

## The Complete YAML-file 

Let's check out the final YAML file for the Cookie Consent plugin with the basic information, with the default settings, and with the field definitions for the user interface:

````

      required: true
    dismiss:

      label: Label for Button
      placeholder: 'Got it'
      required: true
    popup_background:
      type: color
      label: Background Color of Popup
      placeholder: 'Add hex color value like #ffffff'
      required: true
    popup_text:
      type: color
      label: Text Color of Popup
      placeholder: 'Add hex color value like #ffffff'
      required: true
    button_background:
      type: color
      label: Background Color of Button
      placeholder: 'Add hex color value like #ffffff'
      required: true
    button_text:
      type: color
      label: Text Color of Button
      placeholder: 'Add hex color value like #ffffff'
      required: true
````

What else is there to say? Well, our plugin is ready now. 

Hurrah!!!!
