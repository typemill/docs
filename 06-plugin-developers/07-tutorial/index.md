# Plugin Tutorial

In this short tutorial, we will create the **Cookie Consent plugin** step by step and learn about the **file structure**, about the **YAML configuration files**, and about the basic **PHP file** for the plugin. You will also learn how to register **events**, how to use your own **templates**, and how to create a **user interface** for your plugin. Everything is pretty simple, and the tutorial can be finished in one hour or two.
