# onContentArrayLoaded

This event is triggered after the markdown content of a page has been converted into an array by the parsedown library and before the array has been transformed into html. This is useful if you want to insert content after specific html-elements.

## Availability

This event is available on all frontend pages.

## Data

Plugins **must** return a content-array for this event; otherwise, the content will not be available in the frontend.

| Getter/Setter | Type | Required | Description | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| getData | array | - | A multi-dimensional array of content elements generated by the parsedown library. | 
| setData | array | required | The original or modified content array that is used by parsedown to create the html for the frontend. |
