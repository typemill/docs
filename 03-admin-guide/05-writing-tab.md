| Feature | Description | 
|:---|:---|
| Standard Editor Mode | Choose between the visual markdown editor or raw editor as the standard editor mode. | 
| Format options for visual editor | Configure the formatting options for the visual editor. Note that this only affects the visible buttons; it does not impact the markdown syntax that you can use. | 
| Headline anchors | Show anchors next to headlines on the frontend. Note that this feature is not implemented in all themes. | 
| URL schemes | URL schemes for external links are whitelisted in the markdown parser. You can extend the whitelist with more URL schemes, e.g., dict:// (comma-separated list). |
