#  Project Tab

In the project tab, you can create multiple projects for your website. Each project has its own navigation and is separated from other projects. Read the details in the [author guide](/author-guide/multi-project).

| Setting | Description | 
|:---|:---|
| Multi-Project Website | Enable or disable the multi-project setting for the website. | 
| Frontend Project Switch | You can activate a dropdown to switch between the projects on the frontend website. | 
| Project Homepage | If activated, the logo of the frontend website will link to the startpage of the current project and not to the general homepage. This depends on the theme implementation. | 
| Base Project ID | You have to add an ID for your standard website. This ID is used to identify your default website when you switch projects. Different from project IDs, the base ID is not part of the URL, so the URL for your default website stays the same. | 
| Base Project Label | This is the visible label in the project switch in the author environment and on the frontend website (if project switch for frontend is activated). | 
| Additional Projects | Here you can add IDs (left field) and labels (right field) for each project that you want to create. |
