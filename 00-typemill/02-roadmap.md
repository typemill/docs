# Roadmap

There are a lot of plans for future releases of TYPEMILL, but it also follows the concept of simplicity. To prevent TYPEMILL from becomming a feature soup, it will strictly focus on the writers needs.

Here are some **milestones** of the past:

* Introduction of TYPEMILL (v. 1.0.0)
* Added a google sitemap (v. 1.0.1)
* Added a table of contents tag (TOC) (v. 1.0.5)
* Introduced plugins (v. 1.1.0)
* Added an author panel for configurations (v. 1.1.3)
* Added math support (mathjax/katex) (v. 1.1.5) 
* Added a basic content editor to edit and delete existing pages (v. 1.2.0)
* Added a draft management for pages (v. 1.2.2)
* Re-order content pages with drag&drop (v. 1.2.3)
* Create new pages (v. 1.2.5)
* Use a visual markdown editor with content blocks (v. 1.2.6)
* Reorder content blocks (v. 1.2.7)
* Upload and handle images (v. 1.2.8)

* Editor & Plugin: Add math with the pandoc syntax (v. 1.2.15)
* Editor & Plugin: Search plugin and footnotes in visual mode (v. 1.2.16)

And here is the **roadmap** of the future:

* Editor: Edit inline formats like links, bold and italic (v. 1.2.17 - 1.2.19)
* Add meta-data to a page (v. 1.3.0)
* Add more plugins (v. 1.3.1)
* Add more themes (v. 1.3.2)
* Add output formats like mobi, epub and more (v. 1.3.3)

In the long run, TYPEMILL should become a lightweight but fully featured publishing system with many more features: 

* Additional output formats like mobi, epub and pdf.
* Member area with pro-content.
* Microservices for pro-features like job-adds, service providers or text-adds. 
* Many more themes.
* Plugins for search, comments, RSS, E-Mails, newsletters and much more.
