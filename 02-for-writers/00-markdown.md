# Markdown

TYPEMILL uses Markdown for writing. Never heard of Markdown? Markdown is a simple syntax for text formatting and it is very similar to the markup used by wikipedia. Markdown uses a handful of special characters like `#` of `*` to format the text. 

The big advantage for writers: They don't have to click a button to format a headline or to create a list. Instead they can format the text during the writing process without an interruption. And this speeds up your writing process tremendously. This is a short example for a markdown text: 

````
# My first level headline
 
This is a paragraph and now we create an unordered list:
 
- Item
- Another item
- A last item
````

Markdown is used by a lot of technology platforms like GitHub or StackOverflow, but is also entering the non technical mainstream with popular tools like Trello or Slack.
