["# Architecture","Typemill follows some well known principles in the architecture.","## Mode-View-Controller (MVC)","The code in Typemill is mostly organized following the Model-View-Controller Architecture, and you will find the folders \"model\" and \"controller\" in the system folder. The controllers contain most of the business logic of the application, while the models contain more abstract methods to handle the content, the navigation, the folders and all storage operations.","## Internal REST API","Nearly the whole internal logic of Typemill is build upon an internal API, that mostly follows REST principles. So nearly all controllers in Typemill will return JSON-data that can be used in the frontend.","Different to pure Headless Content Management Systems and pure REST APIs, Typemill uses sessions for authentication and is not fully stateless.","## Event Driven Application","Typemill works with Events and the event dispatcher from Symfony PHP Framework. Events are a central feature for plugin development."]
